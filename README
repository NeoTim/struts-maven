Struts Build
============

This subproject provides common build components for use across multiple Struts
subprojects. While it is a subproject in and of itself, it is better thought of
as a shared directory linked into each individual subproject.

IMPORTANT:
If you are reading this in the 'build' directory of another subproject, what
you are seeing is a "window" into the build subproject. All of the files in
this directory are actually maintained in the common build subproject, and so
any changes made here will be made for *all* subprojects.
